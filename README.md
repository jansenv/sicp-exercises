This repo initially started as place to track my progress through the exercises for MIT's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) 
while I was searching for my first development job. I do not want to conceal that most of the exercises were incredibly challenging for me at the time 
and most of 'my' answers were simply copy and pasted from the web.

The project was very short-lived since I was lucky in finding work quickly, but 5 years later I've returned to re-examine the fundamentals. I'm satisfied to discover
that the problems feel much easier to grasp after some experience, though still often challenging.

Instead of trying to work through every single book problem in a completionist fashion, I discovered some great resources such as 
Brian Harveyâ€™s SICP lectures (for the 61A course at Berkeley) as well as coursework materials supplied at https://romanbird.github.io/sicp/
that I will be using instead. I'm attempting to work through them at my own pace doing most of the homework, projects, labs, etc.

I'm still not above copy-pasting, but I'll provide a solid attempt at supplying my own answers as often as possible!

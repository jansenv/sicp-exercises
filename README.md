This repo is for tracking my progress through the exercises for MIT's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), which I started doing
while I was searching for my first development job (I make no bones that most of the exercises here were incredibly challenging for me at the time 
and most of 'my' answers were simply copy and pasted from the web after much frustration).

The project was very short-lived since I was lucky in finding work quickly, but I like to return every now and then to examine the fundamentals. I'm satisfied to discover
that the problems DO get easier after some experience, though still very challenging.

Later on I discovered some great resources such as Brian Harveyâ€™s SICP lectures (for the 61A course at Berkeley) as well as coursework materials supplied at https://romanbird.github.io/sicp/
so I created another folder for the work associated with that, since the problems are pretty similar and solutions are programmed using the same development environment.

Feel free to ignore or criticize my shoddy work, I just like having this little repo on my profile for something that makes me feel productive outside of my job :)
